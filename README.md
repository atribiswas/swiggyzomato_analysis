We all love food that arrives to us in time in proper condition, right? But the delivery partners who deliver us the food need to be praised for their hard work and dedication towards our satisfaction as well! Here is some insight into the [data I obtained from kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cbhavik/swiggyzomato-order-information) and some analysis on the same.

**We will be looking at:**
1.  Deliveries by each partner sorted and plotted
2.  Normal distribution of the amount of successful deliveries by delivery partners
3.  Frequency of deliveries over the span of the given 12 days of data
4.  Average frequency of delivery for any given day over 24 hours
5.  Exact frequency of deliveries of each day over 24 hour period
